## Casimir Effect Engine

![Casimir Effect Engine](casimir_effect_engine.png?raw=true)

The device design assumes a more ideal mott insulator than is described in [this article]( http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/jul/25/prototype-mott-transistor-developed).

* The capacitor structure is charged up in the initial state of the device.
* The electric field makes the mott insulator conducting. Because the mott insulator is conducting there is a strong casimir force between the mott insulator plates.
* The casimir force brings the mott insulator plates together and does work on the spring.
* The contacts short out the capacitor structure which removes the electric field.
* The mott insulator is turned into an insulator which reduces the casimir force.
* The spring pushes the mott insulator plates apart and does work on the piezoelectric.
* The piezoelectric charges the capacitor structure back up.

The below equations are taken from [here](http://www.quantumfields.com/IEEEJMEMSACO.pdf):

![eq 1](eq01.png?raw=true)

The above equation is the Casimir pressure.

![eq 2](eq02.png?raw=true)

The above parameter is equal to 1 when the plates are in a conducting state. The key idea is that this parameter changes with time.

## Rotating systems

[The Hunt For Zero Point](https://books.google.com/books?id=b97ahFqu_U4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false) goes into depth about rotating systems. [Eugene Podkletnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Podkletnov) built a gravity shielding system out of a rotating superconductor. With the [G&ouml;del solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric) the universe rotates and allows for time travel. A rotating superconductor could be a simulation of a rotating universe. Time travel allows for free energy: go back into time and the steal the same electron. Does a simulation of time travel happen in a spinning superconductor?

## Infinite information in finite space

Per [Holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) the amount of information contained in a volume is proportional to the surface area of the volume. If the volume is a [Menger sponge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) then an infinite amount of information is stored in zero amount of space.
